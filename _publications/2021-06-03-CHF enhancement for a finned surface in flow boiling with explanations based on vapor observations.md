excerpt: 'In this study, effects of a finned structure on downward-facing flow boiling were investigated. Compared to a bare surface, a heated surface with a finned structure has a higher CHF and heat transfer coefficient. Two high-speed cameras were utilized to observe boiling behaviors from the downward view and side view. Under low heat flux conditions, there existed a front zone and wake zone due to the existence of the extended heating surface, which was confirmed by a numerical simulation. The bubbles tended to escape from two sides of the extended surface. Under high heat flux conditions, two vapor films formed due to the existence of the finned structure, allowing more water to be supplied to the surface. Meanwhile, the existence of the fin enhanced the turbulence and made the flow field velocity distribution non-uniform, thus enhancing heat transfer and CHF. The maximum vapor film thickness of finned surface was larger than that of the bare surface. A larger maximum volume of vapor generating on the surface suggested a larger amount of latent heat consumption and thus, leading to a bigger CHF. These results demonstrated the potential of CHF enhancement using the finned structure design.'

##Introductions
Nucleate boiling has been applied in many areas such as heat exchangers, high power electronics and advanced reactors due to its high efficiency in removing heat by phase change (Patil and Kandlikar, 2014; Wu et al., 2018). However, critical heat flux (CHF) greatly limits the utilization of nucleate boiling. Under nucleate boiling conditions, large amounts of heat can be taken away by the rapid phase change process. However, after CHF point, if further heat flux is supplied, the temperature of

##Experimental works
Fig. 1 depicts the experimental facility for studying the finned surface. The main flow channel has a length of about 1 m, a width of 40 mm and a height of 10 mm. The channel was made of acrylic. Two high-speed cameras could be utilized to observe the heating surface from two sides. The two cameras were synchronized and controlled by a software PFV ver.3641. The time difference between the two cameras was smaller than 1 ms. During the experiment, the high-speed cameras were operated at 1000

##Boiling curves and CHF
The experimental conditions are shown in Table 1.

Fig. 3 depicts the boiling curves for the bare surface and finned surface. The superheating is defined as follows.where  is the superheating and  is the saturation temperature of the fluid. For each working condition, two experiments denoted as 1 and 2 were conducted to ensure the reproducibility. Compared to the bare surface, the finned structure surface has a smaller superheating and a large CHF for each mass flux. Heat

##Conclusions
Downward-facing flow boiling experiments were conducted to investigate effects of the finned surface. The heat transfer coefficient and CHF of the finned structure is bigger than that of the bare surface. The mechanisms are illustrated by interpretations of the bubble behaviors and a pressure field obtained by numerical simulations. Some of the conclusions are:

The finned structure has a higher heat transfer coefficient and CHF than that of the bare surface in downward-facing boiling for each
