excerpt: 'In this study, experiments of downward-facing flow boiling were conducted to investigate material effects on CHF. Experiments were conducted using aluminum, copper, and carbon steel. It was found that different materials had different CHFs. Aluminum has the biggest CHF while copper has the lowest CHF for each mass flux. After experiment, surface wettability increased and surface became rougher, which was probably due to the oxidation process during nucleate boiling. The CHF difference is likely to be related to the surface wettability, roughness and thermal effusivity, which influences the bubble behavior and in turn affects CHF. Further studies are needed to determine which factor is dominant.'

#Abstract
In this study, experiments of downward-facing flow boiling were conducted to investigate material effects on CHF. Experiments were conducted using aluminum, copper, and carbon steel. It was found that different materials had different CHFs. Aluminum has the biggest CHF while copper has the lowest CHF for each mass flux. After experiment, surface wettability increased and surface became rougher, which was probably due to the oxidation process during nucleate boiling. The CHF difference is likely to be related to the surface wettability, roughness and thermal effusivity, which influences the bubble behavior and in turn affects CHF. Further studies are needed to determine which factor is dominant.
