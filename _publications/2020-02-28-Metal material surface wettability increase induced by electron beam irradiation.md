excerpt: 'Due to the important role critical heat flux (CHF) plays in the nucleate boiling field, it is of great significance to study CHF, especially the mechanism of boiling crisis occurrence. In this study, an extended numerical model to predict CHF for flow boiling was proposed based on the Monte Carlo method. This model considers of the bubble generation, bubble growth and bubble departure. CHF was assumed based on the percolative nature of bubble interactions. Numerical simulation results showed good agreement with the experimental results, which demonstrated that this model was able to be used to predict CHF. Further works are needed to apply this model to a wider range of experiments and other working conditions.'

#Highlights
•The surface wettability of different metal and pre-oxidized metal surfaces can be increased by electron beam irradiation.
•The surface wettability increases as the irradiation dose increases.
•Electron beam irradiation show better effect on increasing the surface wettability of pre-oxidized metal surface.
